Production-style Azure data engineering project that ingests macroeconomic risk signals from the **FRED API**, lands them in **ADLS Gen2**, transforms them with **Azure Databricks** into **silver/gold** datasets, and exposes the curated gold output through **Azure Synapse Serverless SQL** (no SQL database required).
